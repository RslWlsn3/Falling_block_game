# Falling_block_game
This is a game where you try to dodge the falling blocks. The player can use the left and right arrow keys to move. The blocks drop randomly at a steady speed. The game is over when the player block(red) collides with one of the enemy blocks(blue). The score at the bottom left indicates how many blocks the player has successfully dodged.
